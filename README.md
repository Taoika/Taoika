Taoika is currently in college, majoring in computer science and technology.

Taoika has many interests, including but not limited to web development 💎, guitar playing 🎸, singing 🎤, sketching 🎨, etc. Of course~, they are still at an amateur level 🚬, but Taoika is also continuing to work hard, now I am also learning skills of web.

Recently, I have also tried to integrate some relatively new technologies🙀, new ideas, and new architectures into a project outside of work.

If interested, you can look through my warehouse, maybe you can find some interesting things~💖
